Hello, everyone!

My name is Seungmin Kim, and I’m passionate AI robotics researcher.

I am currently a master's student in an integrated master's and doctoral program at RILAB, Korea university. Before joining Korea University, I worked as an embedded systems developer in startups from 2020-2023. During my time in the startup environment, I spearheaded a new business initiative known as D2C, an abbreviation for Direct-to-Customer.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea University in Seoul, Korea. Throughout my undergraduate years, I was enthusiastically participated in the intelligent Robotics Club named KAsimov from 2014-2017.
